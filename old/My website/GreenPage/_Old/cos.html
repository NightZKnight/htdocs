<p>This is something that is not real so do not get mad that this was here. It was something that was to be funny but, if you don't think it is funny than the wrongness that you have is so much that you do not know what two plus two is. Also if you know that was not real do not throw your computer on that ground because you want it to be real. The only thing that makes senses is that this is not real, I do not know why I wanted to do this but I did so do not get mad at it or you are to sensitive. Something else, you are so dumb if you thought this was real after you read this. One thing you could to make yourself smarter is to do some school. Also you could learn some common sense or something of that sort.</p>
