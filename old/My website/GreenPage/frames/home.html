<br>This is a green page that is very green indeed.  It is so green that it makes trees look purple. So green that I am worried that you might go green color blind. This green page is green like grass but the grass is not as green as this because it looks purple.

<br>One green morning I found a green cup in my green house. The sun, as I walk on the green carpet, shined through the green curtains. While shading my eyes from the bright sun, I thought to myself, “I’m thirsty, I’ll get some juice.” Filling my cup with green juice, I noticed a crack in my green tile. “Oh no, I need to go to the hardware store to buy tools to fix this.” I thought. So I got my keys to my green car and drove to the store. As I was walking to the tile repair aisle I saw a—PURPLE PLANT! “OH NO, THE WORLD IS ENDING—AHHHHHHHHHH!” I franticly screamed. The store clerk noticing that I saw those purple plants said, “NO, NO! The world is not ending; those are just imports from Purple Island.” Then a purple gene that came out of nowhere said, <i>“The greatest place on planet Colour”</i> The store clerk replied, “Get out of here, you fool, you can’t just show up every time some says that!”
<br>”If I didn’t, a guy from the secret service who just said that would have caught me!” replied the gene. “Well, if they were ‘secret service’ than how do you know about them?” said the clerk. “I did… what are you… O, shut up. It’s just a name.” replied the gene. “What does the secret service want with you?” I said. The gene replied, “Well, you know there has been some conflict between Green Country and Purple Island, <i>‘The greatest pla</i>… they think I'm a spy.”
