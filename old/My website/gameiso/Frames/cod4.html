<p>Leveling up is easy. All you have to do is kill and win and you get xp. If you complete a challenge, you might unlock an attachment or get some xp.</p>
<p>When you play sabotage, capture the flag, or search and destroy, you should use remote detonated explosives. If you are on the defending side, go to A or B. Once at A or B, place 2 C4 and watch the site from a building or something. When a person is spotted, BLOW HIM UP!!!</p>
<p>If you are on the attacking side, repeat AFTER you plant the bomb.</p>
