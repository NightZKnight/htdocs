<p>Terraria multiplayer is the same as single player except more people.</p>
<p>Terraria has four teams which allows you to have war or let you work together to "finish" the game. Any players on the same team will know how to get to their teammates. The way to play CTF (capture the flag) is to make a big gem, because when you are killed you drop the big gem which allows anybody to pick it back up to either return it or capture it.</p>
<p>Or you can play "The Hunger Games," which can be done with teams or free for all. Playing "Hunger Games" is very simple, all you have to do is build up then kill anybody not on your team.</p>
