<p>If you want to get everything in the game, unlock the following artifacts (it will make it SOOOOO much easier): "Glass" and "Command."</p>
You will also need the bandit because the glass artifact makes him super powerful. Artifact kin isn't that important, but you should still get it. If you play multiplayer, you should tell your host to have the artifacts, Glass, Command, and Kin. Also you should suggest to everyone playing to use the bandit. If they don't, well, that's just too bad.</p>
