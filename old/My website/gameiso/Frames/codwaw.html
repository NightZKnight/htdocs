<p>CoD WaW is the same as CoD4 except for different guns and a new game type called "War". You still can level up like CoD4, and you do it the same way. When you play sabotage, capture the flag, or search and destroy, you should use remote detonated explosives. If you are on the defending side, go to A or B. Once at A or B, place 2 C4 and watch the site from a building or something. When a person is spotted, BLOW HIM UP!!! If you are on the attacking side, repeat AFTER you plant the bomb.</p>
