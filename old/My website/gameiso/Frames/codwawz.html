<p>CoDWaW zombies mode is fun. You can earn xp while in single player zombies, but multiplayer is more fun than single player. CoD Zombies is a four player co-op, and co-op makes everything fun. There is no win, it's just infinite. Round one starts out with easy zombies. Knifing is only useful on the first round. If you are on round 3, you have to knife a zombie 3 times to kill it. On round 5, it takes 5 knife hits. When you kill a zombie, you get some money. That money can buy guns on walls or open the random box. Don't let the zombies hit you 2 times in a row or you will die (single player) or go down (multiplayer).</p>
