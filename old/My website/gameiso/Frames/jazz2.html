<p>This game is great for multiplayer.</p>
<p>In multiplayer you'll want to find the rockets, collect them and run. If you stay there, you will increase the chance of them being found.</p>
<p>There are 3 game modes, battle (deathmatch), CTF (capture the flag), and treasure hunt (collect gems). If you plan on having fun, you should play battle, but if you like games where you need speed, choose CTF or treasure hunt.</p>
